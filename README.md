***Made using flutter***

***Only setup for android. No support for other os was added***

***For the app to work you would have to setup google map api key (it was removed before uploading) in android:value of android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml and "current_key" present in android\app\google-services.json***

***Just use $flutter pub get    in a system with flutter installed and the app should be configured and it would work perfectly after doing the above 2 steps***
